# IMMEDIATE EMAIL SETUP - Get Forms Working NOW!

## 🚨 URGENT: To Get Emails Working Immediately

The forms are currently using a fallback method that opens the user's email client. To get emails sent directly to your inbox, you need to activate FormSubmit.co:

### Step 1: Activate FormSubmit.co (Takes 2 minutes)
1. Go to your website and try to submit the guest attendance form
2. You'll be redirected to FormSubmit.co
3. Check your email `montengro.cyndie1416@gmail.com` for an activation email
4. Click the activation link in the email
5. That's it! Forms will now send emails directly to your inbox

### Step 2: Test the Form
1. Fill out the guest attendance form on any page
2. Submit the form
3. You should receive an email at `montengro.cyndie1416@gmail.com`

## 🔧 Alternative: Use Formspree (If FormSubmit doesn't work)

If FormSubmit doesn't work, here's how to use Formspree:

1. Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form ID (looks like `xqkzqkzq`)
5. Replace the form ID in `js/guest-form.js`:

```javascript
const formServices = [
    'https://formsubmit.co/montengro.cyndie1416@gmail.com',
    'https://formspree.io/f/xblypdkv' // Replace with your actual form ID
];
```

## 🎯 What's Currently Working

✅ **Form validation** - Checks for name and email  
✅ **Loading states** - Shows "Sending..." when submitting  
✅ **Success messages** - Confirms submission to user  
✅ **Form reset** - Clears form after submission  
✅ **Fallback method** - Opens email client if services fail  

## 📧 Email Content You'll Receive

When a guest submits the form, you'll receive an email with:
- **Subject**: "Wedding Guest Attendance - [Guest Name]"
- **Content**: Guest's name, email, and confirmation message
- **From**: The guest's email address
- **To**: montengro.cyndie1416@gmail.com

## 🚀 Quick Test

1. Open any page of your wedding website
2. Scroll to the "Are You Attending?" section
3. Fill in a test name and email
4. Click "I am Attending"
5. Check if you receive an email

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**If no email is received:**
1. Check your spam folder
2. Make sure you activated FormSubmit.co
3. Try the Formspree alternative
4. The fallback mailto method should always work

**If forms don't submit:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure all JavaScript files are loaded
3. Try refreshing the page

## 📱 Mobile Testing

The forms work on mobile devices too! Test on your phone to make sure everything works properly.
