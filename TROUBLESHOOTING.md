# Troubleshooting Guide - Wedding Photo Upload System

## "Failed to fetch" Error Resolution

### Step 1: Verify Google Apps Script Setup

1. **Check Script URL**:
   - Make sure your Google Apps Script URL ends with `/exec` (not `/dev`)
   - Current URL: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzqhjk9xjME1X18aiBkVTDdW0NtDzLaR8s5BTrSZa5uWHtdpK5gK5e05w4HqhBFEgYv/exec`

2. **Test Script Directly**:
   - Open `test-google-script.html` in your browser
   - Click "Test GET" - should show "Wedding Photo Upload Service is running!"
   - If GET fails, your script deployment has issues

3. **Redeploy Script**:
   - Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
   - Open your project
   - Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Manage deployments"
   - Click the pencil icon to edit
   - Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Copy the new `/exec` URL

### Step 2: Update Website URLs

After getting the new script URL, update these files:

**In `js/photo-upload.js` (line 15):**
```javascript
const GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_NEW_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
```

**In `admin-photos.html` (line 378):**
```javascript
const RENAME_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_NEW_SCRIPT_URL_HERE';
```

### Step 3: Test Upload Functionality

1. **Upload a Test Photo**:
   - Go to your wedding website gallery page
   - Fill out the guest photo upload form
   - Upload a test image
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Check Google Drive**:
   - Look for a "Wedding Guest Photos" folder
   - Check for date-based subfolders
   - Verify files are being created

3. **Check Email Notifications**:
   - Look for confirmation emails
   - Check spam folder if needed

### Step 4: Test Admin Panel

1. **Open Admin Panel**:
   - Go to `admin-photos.html`
   - Check if uploaded photos appear
   - Verify images are displaying

2. **Test Approval/Rejection**:
   - Click "Approve" on a pending submission
   - Check if files are renamed in Google Drive
   - Verify admin panel updates

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to fetch" on GET request
**Solution**: 
- Redeploy your Google Apps Script
- Make sure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"
- Use the `/exec` endpoint URL

### Issue: Images not displaying in admin panel
**Solution**:
- Check if `google_drive_url` is stored in submission data
- Verify file permissions are set to "Anyone with link can view"
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Issue: File renaming not working
**Solution**:
- Ensure the script has the `handleRename` function
- Check that file IDs are being stored correctly
- Verify the rename script URL is correct

### Issue: No email notifications
**Solution**:
- Check if Gmail API is enabled in Google Apps Script
- Verify the admin email address is correct
- Check spam folder

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Google Apps Script responds to GET request
- [ ] Photo upload creates files in Google Drive
- [ ] Admin panel displays uploaded images
- [ ] Approval/rejection renames files

- [ ] File permissions allow public viewing

## Debug Information

### Check Browser Console

- Network errors
- JavaScript errors
- CORS issues

### Check Google Apps Script Logs
1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your project
3. Click "Executions" in the left sidebar
4. Check recent executions for errors

### Test URLs
- **GET Test**: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_ID/exec`
- **POST Test**: Use the test form in `test-google-script.html`

## Emergency Fix

If nothing works, try this simplified script:

```javascript
function doGet(e) {
  return ContentService
    .createTextOutput("Wedding Photo Upload Service is running!")
    .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.TEXT);
}

function doPost(e) {
  try {
    const params = e.parameter;
    
    if (params.action === 'rename') {
      const file = DriveApp.getFileById(params.fileId);
      file.setName(params.newName);
      return ContentService
        .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({success: true}))
        .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
    }
    
    // Simple upload
    const blob = Utilities.newBlob("Test file", "text/plain", "test.txt");
    const file = DriveApp.createFile(blob);
    
    return ContentService
      .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({
        success: true,
        fileId: file.getId(),
        fileUrl: file.getDownloadUrl()
      }))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
      
  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService
      .createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({
        success: false,
        message: error.toString()
      }))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}
```

This minimal script should work for basic testing.
